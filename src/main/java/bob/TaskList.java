/**
 * The tasks the user has told the chatbot about, in the order they were added,
 * together with the operations the chatbot performs on them.
 *
 * <p>This was a bare {@link ArrayList} field in {@link Bob}, reached into
 * directly by every command. Every one of them therefore had to know that the
 * tasks were kept in a list, that the list counts from 0 while the user counts
 * from 1, and how to walk it. Wrapping the list in a class of its own gives that
 * knowledge one home: {@code Bob} now asks this class for what it wants and no
 * longer touches the list itself.
 *
 * <p>Positions matter here in a way they do not in an ordinary collection. The
 * user names a task by the number it has in {@link Command#LIST}, so a shortened
 * listing is only useful if it shows each task under that same number — a number
 * counting the matches could not be typed into {@code mark} or {@code delete}.
 * That is why {@link #findIndexes} and {@link #findIndexesSoonestFirst} return
 * positions in this list rather than the tasks they found: the position is the
 * part the user needs, and the task can be fetched with {@link #get}.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here validates what the user typed and nothing here prints. A task
 * number that names no task is refused by {@link Bob}, which is where there is
 * still a user to explain it to; this class assumes it is given a position that
 * exists, exactly as a plain list would.

     * <p>This is an {@link ArrayList} rather than a fixed-size array. Since tasks
     * can be deleted as well as added, a plain array would mean growing it by hand
     * when it filled up, and shifting every later element down by one on every
     * deletion while tracking how many slots are still in use. An
     * {@code ArrayList} does all of that itself: {@code add} grows it,
     * {@code remove} closes the gap, and {@code size} always says how many tasks
     * there are, so there is no separate count that could drift out of step with
     * the contents.
     *
     * <p>Each element is a {@link Task}. Because {@link Todo}, {@link Deadline}
     * and {@link Event} are all subclasses of {@link Task}, one list of
     * {@code Task} can hold any mixture of the three, and the code that lists,
     * marks or deletes them needs to know only that each is a task.
