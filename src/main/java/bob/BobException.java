/**
 * An error in what the user asked the chatbot to do, described in words that
 * can be shown to the user as-is.
 *
 * <p>Using an exception lets the code that works out what a command means stop
 * as soon as something is wrong, without also having to know how the chatbot
 * shows things. Every such error travels up to one place — the
 * {@code handleCommand} method of {@link Bob} — which catches it and hands the
 * message to {@link bob.ui.Ui Ui} as the answer. So the rule "an unusable
 * command is reported, not obeyed" is enforced in a single place instead of in
 * every command, and it is enforced there for both front ends at once: a window
 * runs its commands through the same method the console loop does.
 *
 * <p>It extends {@code Exception} rather than {@code RuntimeException} so the
 * compiler insists that it is either handled or declared. A mistyped command is
 * an expected part of talking to a chatbot, so it should be impossible to forget
 * to deal with it.
 *
 * <p>A single exception class is enough here because the chatbot's only response
 * to any of these errors is to print the message. If different errors ever
 * needed different handling, the usual next step would be subclasses (say
 * {@code UnknownCommandException}) so that {@code catch} could tell them apart.
