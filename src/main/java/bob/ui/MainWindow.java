/**
 * The chatbot's window: the conversation so far, and the box the user types into.
 *
 * <p>This class is to the window what {@link bob.Bob Bob}'s command loop is to the console. It
 * does the same three things — take a line from the user, have the chatbot answer
 * it, show the answer — but driven by the user pressing a key or a button rather
 * than by a loop, because that is how a window works: nothing happens until
 * somebody does something, and then a method runs in response.
 *
 * <p>What the window looks like is not here. It is in
 * {@code /view/MainWindow.fxml}, which names this class as its controller and each
 * of the four controls below with the same name the field has. That split is worth
 * having because the two are changed for different reasons and by different means:
 * the arrangement, sizes and colors are adjusted by eye, and can be adjusted in
 * the FXML without recompiling anything, while what the buttons <em>do</em> is
 * decided here.
 *
 * <p>It knows nothing about tasks, commands or save files. It hands the line the
 * user typed to {@link Bob#getResponse} and is given back the text to show, which
 * is why adding a command to the chatbot needs no change here at all.

     * the point: an answer that appears in the same instant as the question reads
     * as a lookup, and a conversation is what this window is meant to look like.

     * points at this method, so the two are the same action and not two that have
     * to be kept in step.
     *
     * <p>An empty box is ignored. At a console an empty line is worth complaining
     * about, since the user may not have meant to send one; here the box is in
     * front of them and plainly empty, so a complaint would say only what they can
     * already see. The box is emptied before that is decided, so that a box holding

     * than looking blank while quietly refusing to send.

     * <p>The chatbot's bubble appears straight away but empty, and is filled in
     * after {@link #TYPING_PAUSE}, so that the answer looks composed rather than
     * looked up. What the chatbot said is settled before either bubble is shown —
     * the pause is in the showing, not in the answering — which is why the answer
     * and everything about it are read out of {@link Bob} here rather than inside
     * the lambda: by the time that runs, the chatbot may have been asked something
     * else and be describing that instead.

     * mistyped command does not look like a command that worked.
     *
     * <p>Saying goodbye closes the window, but not at once. The farewell is shown
     * first and the window closes a moment later, so the user sees the chatbot
     * answer rather than the window vanishing as they press the key. Typing is
     * disabled from the moment the goodbye is understood, so nothing can be sent to
     * a chatbot that has already said goodbye.
