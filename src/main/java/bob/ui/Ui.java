/**
 * Everything the chatbot says to the user and everything it hears back.
 *
 * <p>This was part of {@link bob.Bob Bob}, mixed in with the code that decides what each
 * command does. Two quite different questions were being answered in the one
 * class: <em>what</em> to tell the user, and <em>how</em> a line of chatbot
 * output looks on screen. This class now answers the second one alone.
 *
 * <p>What that buys is that the shape of the conversation is stated in one
 * place. The indent, the horizontal rules framing each block, the banner and the
 * greeting all live here, so changing how the chatbot looks is a change to this
 * file and to no other. {@link bob.Bob Bob} is left saying what it wants said, in lines
 * of plain text, and never touches {@code System.out} itself.
 *
 * <p>Reading the user's input belongs here for the same reason: it is the other
 * half of the same conversation, and keeping it here means no other class has to
 * know that the input happens to arrive on {@code System.in} through a
 * {@link Scanner}.
 *
 * <p>What this class knows has since grown from the frame around the output to
 * the output itself: how a task is written in a listing, how a listing is laid
 * out, and the fixed wording of the confirmations. Those were composed line by
 * line by whoever ran the command, which meant the numbering of a listing was
 * written out afresh in each of the four commands that produce one. The wording
 * that varies with the command — the heading naming a day, say — is still passed
 * in, since only the command knows what it looked for.
 *
 * <p>That makes this class depend on {@link Task} and {@link TaskList}, which is
 * the right way round: what shows the tasks may know what a task is, while a
 * task knows nothing about being shown.
 *
 * <p>There are now two places that output can go, because the chatbot has two
 * front ends: the console it started with, and a window that shows the same
 * conversation in speech bubbles.
 * Rather than a second class saying all the same things a different way, one
 * {@code Ui} comes in two shapes — {@link #forConsole()} and {@link #forGui()} —
 * and every caller says what it wants said in exactly the same way whichever
 * shape it holds. Only the handful of methods that actually touch the screen ask
 * which shape they are, and what they do about it is set out on each of them.
 *
 * <p>Output is built up as a <em>block</em>: {@link #openBlock()}, then one
 * {@link #showLine} per line, then {@link #closeBlock()}. The block is what
 * separates one answer from the next on screen, and letting the caller print its
 * lines one at a time is what lets an answer be as long as it needs to be —
 * a listing of every task, say — without this class having to know in advance
 * how many lines that will take.
