/**
 * Runs the chatbot as a windowed program.
 *
 * <p>This is the graphical counterpart of {@link Bob#main}: it makes a chatbot,
 * gives it something to talk through, and steps aside. The difference is that a
 * console program then runs a loop until the input ends, while this one hands its
 * window to JavaFX and returns — from there on the user's typing and clicking are
 * what make anything happen, and {@link MainWindow} answers them.
 *
 * <p>Extending {@link Application} is what makes this class a JavaFX program:
 * {@link Application#launch} sets up the toolkit, opens a window, and calls
 * {@link #start} on the thread that JavaFX draws on. That launch is done from
 * {@link bob.Launcher Launcher} rather than from a {@code main} here, for the reason given there.
 *
 * <p>The chatbot is made here, and only here, so that the window below is left
 * knowing how to show a conversation without also having to decide whose it is or
 * where its tasks are kept. It reads and writes the same save file as the console
 * chatbot, so a task added in one is there in the other.
