 * <p>An event may not end before it starts, nor start and end at the same moment.
 * That rule is {@link #requireValidPeriod}, and it is checked on every route by which
 * an event reaches the task list: when one is added, by {@link bob.parser.Parser Parser};
 * when one is edited, by {@link #buildEdited}; and when one is read back from the save
 * file, by {@link bob.storage.Storage Storage}. The constructor does not check it, so
 * that {@code Storage} can report a broken rule in the short wording it uses for every
