/**
 * Represents a point in time attached to a task: the day it falls on, and the
 * time of day when the user gave one.
 *
 * <p>{@link Deadline} and {@link Event} used to keep whatever the user typed as
 * plain text, so {@code 2026-12-02}, {@code Sunday} and {@code no idea :-p} were
 * all equally acceptable and all equally meaningless to the chatbot. Holding a
 * real {@link LocalDate} instead means the date has been understood rather than
 * merely copied: it can be shown back in a friendlier form than it was typed in,
 * and two of them can be compared to answer questions such as which task is due
 * first — neither of which can be done with a string.
 *
 * <p>That comparing is what {@link bob.command.CommandWord#ON CommandWord.ON},
 * {@link bob.command.CommandWord#BEFORE CommandWord.BEFORE},
 * {@link bob.command.CommandWord#AFTER CommandWord.AFTER} and
 * {@link bob.command.CommandWord#NEXT CommandWord.NEXT} are built on. This class
 * implements {@link Comparable} so that a list of dates can be sorted, and offers
 * {@link #isOn}, {@link #isBefore} and {@link #isAfter} so that the code asking
 * the questions can stay in terms of days rather than reaching inside for the
 * {@link LocalDate} and comparing it itself.
 *
 * <p>The price is that text which is not a date can no longer be accepted, so
 * {@code no idea :-p} is now refused with an explanation instead of being stored.
 * Keeping both — a date when the text parses as one, free text when it does not —
 * is possible, but it means every part of the program that reads a date has to
 * cope with two kinds of answer, which is a lot of complication to buy back a
 * habit the requirements are asking to drop.
 *
 * <p>This class is immutable: both fields are {@code final} and neither
 * {@link LocalDate} nor {@link LocalTime} can be changed after it is made. A
 * {@code TaskDateTime} can therefore be passed around freely, with no risk of one
 * holder of it seeing another holder's change.
