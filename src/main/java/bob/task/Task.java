/**
 * Represents a single task the chatbot remembers: what the user wants to do,
 * and whether it has been done yet.
 *
 * <p>This class holds only what every kind of task has in common. The kinds the
 * chatbot supports — {@link Todo}, {@link Deadline} and {@link Event} — extend it
 * and add whatever is particular to them, so the shared parts are written once
 * here instead of being repeated three times.
 *
 * <p>It is {@code abstract} because "a task" on its own is not something the user
 * can add: every task the chatbot stores is one of the three kinds. Declaring it
 * abstract has the compiler enforce that, rather than leaving it to be remembered.
 *
 * <p>What a task is made of is private to this class, and the subclasses reach it
 * only through the methods below, which is all they need: {@link Deadline} and
 * {@link Event} add dates of their own, and no kind of task sets the description
 * or the done status itself. Keeping the fields private is what lets this class
 * promise that a task's description is the one it was made with, and that its
 * status only ever changes through {@link #markAsDone()} and
 * {@link #markAsNotDone()}.
