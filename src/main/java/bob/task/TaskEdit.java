/**
 * The changes one {@code edit} asks for: a new description, a new due date, a new
 * start or a new end, any of which may be left out.
 *
 * <p>The four are held together as one value rather than passed around as four
 * separate arguments, because three of them are dates: a method taking them side by
 * side would compile just as happily with the start and the end the wrong way round.
 *
 * <p>A detail that is not being changed is {@code null}. {@link java.util.Optional}
 * would say the same without {@code null}, but it is meant for return values rather
 * than for fields, so the plainer field is used and the meaning is written down here,
 * as {@link TaskDateTime} does for a date given without a time.
 *
 * <p>A record, because this is a plain carrier of values with nothing of its own to
 * protect, like {@link bob.storage.Storage.LoadResult Storage.LoadResult}: the compiler
 * writes its constructor and accessors.
 *
 * @param description the new description, or {@code null} to keep the old one.
 * @param by          the new due date, or {@code null} to keep the old one.
 * @param from        the new start, or {@code null} to keep the old one.
 * @param to          the new end, or {@code null} to keep the old one.
