/**
 * One thing the user has asked the chatbot to do, ready to be carried out.
 *
 * <p>What each command does used to be a branch of a {@code switch} in
 * {@link Bob}, and the arguments each one needed were picked apart in a method
 * of its own beside it. Adding a command meant editing {@code Bob} in three
 * places, and the whole of the chatbot's behavior sat in one class that grew
 * with every command added.
 *
 * <p>Each command is now a class, and carrying one out is a call to
 * {@link #execute}. Which class it is decides what happens, so {@code Bob} no
 * longer has to ask: it is handed a {@code Command} and runs it. Adding a
 * command is now writing a class and naming it in one line of {@link Parser},
 * rather than editing the body of the class that runs the conversation.
 *
 * <p>Every command is given the same three things to work with, whether it
 * needs them or not. A listing ignores the {@link Storage} it is passed, since
 * it changes nothing to save. Handing all three to all of them is what lets the
 * loop in {@code Bob} run any command without knowing which one it holds, and
 * that is the whole point of them sharing a parent.
 *
 * <p>A command is made from what the user typed and then run once. It is not
 * kept afterwards and nothing asks it to run twice, so it holds only what its
 * own line said — a task to add, a number, a day — and is given the task list
 * to act on rather than remembering one.
