/**
 * Prints the tasks whose description contains a keyword, in the order they

 *
 * <p>Whether a task matches is decided by
 * {@link bob.task.Task#matchesKeyword Task.matchesKeyword}, so this command only
 * has to ask — exactly as {@link OnCommand} asks each task whether it falls on a
 * day. That keeps the rule about what counts as a match with the thing being
 * matched, and leaves this class holding only the wording.
 *
 * <p>Like the other listings this one changes nothing, so nothing is saved
 * afterwards and the {@link Storage} it is handed goes unused. The numbers shown
 * against the matches are their numbers in the whole list, so a task found here
 * can be marked or deleted without looking it up again.
